To improve my task I would use the following technologies:
           * Docker (Host the application : contanirisation )
           * Kube (Cluster for diff env like prod,dev,test )
           * Terraform (Infrastructure Customization :  different cloud itergration)
           * Ansible (Felexible : Paraller executions)
           * Jenkins (Pipeline )


To install the program we need have python installed in the local machine.
 # Yum install -y python3

To run the application please run the following commands:

           # cd /home/ec2-user/demo-repo/
           # python3 main.py
